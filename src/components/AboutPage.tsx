              The Disaster Assistance Improvement Programâ€™s (DAIP) mission is to provide disaster survivors with information, support, services, and a means to access and apply for disaster assistance through joint data-sharing efforts between federal, tribal, state, local, and private sector partners.

              On August 29, 2006, President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13411. DAIP was created in response to this order. Our goal is to improve survivor access to disaster information and make applying for disaster assistance easier. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), acts as the managing partner.
