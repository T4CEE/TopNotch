              FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers (DRCs) are accessible meeting places set up to provide help after a disaster. There you can learn about FEMA or other assistance programs. You may also ask questions about your case or seek guidance on other disaster-related issues. The services offered at each DRC may vary.
              </h1>
              <h1 className='mt-2 '>
              There are two ways to find a DRC near you:
              </h1>
              <div className="ml-3 mt-3">
                <ul className=" list-disc list-outside ml-3">
                  <li>Use the DRC Locator to find addresses and DRC details. Find info like the hours of operation, services offered, and driving directions.</li>
                  <li>
                  Text DRC and a ZIP code to 43362.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <h1 className='mt-2 '>
              Example: DRC 01234.
              </h1>
              <h1 className='mt-2 '>
              Using this option does not add you to any messaging service. It’s just like doing a search on the web. (Standard text rates may apply.)

              <h1 className='text-[25px] mt-3 xl:mt-7 font-semibold'> Disaster Fraud</h1>
              <h1 className='mt-2 '>
              Too often thieves and other criminals try to take advantage of survivors after a disaster. You may even have heard about scams, identity theft, and fraud in your area. To protect yourself, we encourage you to watch for suspicious activity and be careful who you give personal information to.
              </h1>
              <h1 className='mt-2 '>
              Don’t be afraid to ask for ID or ask questions if someone unknown approaches or calls you.
              </h1>
              <h1 className='mt-2 '>
              Visit the FEMA.gov Disaster Fraud page to get information and contacts to report disaster fraud. Report any known or suspected fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement of disaster relief operations to FEMA or DHS. When you make a report, provide as much information as you can (who, what, when, where, why, and how). You may choose to remain anonymous.
